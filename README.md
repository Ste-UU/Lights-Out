Lights-Out
==========

This is a Java version of the Lights Out game.  The game consists of a 5x5 grid that contains 'lights' that are turned on and off by pressing each one.  Once a light has been pressed, the light selected and all adjacent lights will be switched opposite of what their current status is.  The game starts with a random number of lights turned on.  The point of the game is to get all of the lights off.
